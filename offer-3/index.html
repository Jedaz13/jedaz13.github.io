          <p>You mentioned stress affects your symptoms. Here's what most people don't know:</p>
          <p>Your gut and brain are connected by a nerve called the vagus nerve. It's a direct line. When you're stressed, your brain sends signals that literally tighten your gut, speed up (or slow down) digestion, and trigger symptoms.</p>
          <p>But there's a delay between feeling stress and your gut reacting. Usually 10-30 minutes.</p>
          <p>That's a window. If you calm your nervous system before your gut responds, you can stop symptoms before they start.</p>
          <p><strong>Your protocol includes nervous system support</strong> — specific exercises that shift your body from "fight or flight" to "rest and digest."</p>
