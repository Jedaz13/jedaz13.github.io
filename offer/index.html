          <p><strong>Based on your answers, here's what we found:</strong></p>
          <p>You're dealing with a <strong><span class="gut-pattern">Mixed Pattern</span></strong> — one of the most frustrating patterns because symptoms can swing between extremes, making it hard to identify what's actually triggering your discomfort.</p>

        <div class="diagnosis-section">
          <p>You've been diagnosed with <strong><span class="diagnosis-text"></span></strong> and you've already tried <strong><span class="tried-before">herbal antimicrobials and elimination diets</span></strong>. That tells me you're not lacking effort — you're lacking the right guidance for YOUR specific pattern.</p>

          <p><strong>Here's the good news:</strong> 87% of women with your specific pattern see meaningful improvement within 6-8 weeks when following the right protocol.</p>
          <p><strong>Here's what you need to know:</strong> Without addressing the root cause, these symptoms typically get worse over time — not better. The gut doesn't heal itself through guesswork.</p>

          <p>You've spent years playing detective with your own body. Cutting out gluten. Then dairy. Then FODMAPs. Then seemingly everything enjoyable.</p>
          <p>You've bought the expensive probiotics that promised miracles. The digestive enzymes. The "gut reset" powders. Your bathroom cabinet looks like a pharmacy, and your bank account feels it.</p>
          <p>You've sat in doctors' offices, describing symptoms that consume your daily life, only to hear: <em>"Your tests look normal. Have you tried managing your stress?"</em></p>
          <p>You've Googled symptoms at 2 AM, terrified you're missing something serious, drowning in conflicting advice from people who aren't practitioners.</p>
          <p class="worst-part"><strong>And the worst part?</strong></p>
          <p>Every failed attempt makes you trust yourself — and solutions — a little less.</p>
          <p>You start to wonder: <em>Maybe this is just how my body is now. Maybe I need to accept this.</em></p>

            <p>An ebook can't answer your questions at 10 PM when you're anxious about tomorrow's lunch meeting.</p>
            <p>An app can't interpret WHY you bloated after a meal that should have been "safe."</p>
            <p>A one-off nutritionist visit can't adjust your protocol when you hit a plateau three weeks in.</p>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h4>1. Personalized Practitioner Support</h4>
          <p>Not generic advice. Not AI chatbots. Real registered dietitians and clinical nutritionists who review YOUR case, answer YOUR questions, and adjust YOUR protocol based on YOUR responses.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h4>2. Structured, Evidence-Based Protocols</h4>
          <p>Not random tips from Facebook groups. Week-by-week roadmaps based on clinical research, designed for your specific symptom pattern, that tell you exactly what to do — and when.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="differentiator">
          <h4>3. Community of Women Who Actually Understand</h4>
          <p>Not well-meaning friends who say "just eat more fiber." Women dealing with the same symptoms, following the same structured protocols, supporting each other through the hard days.</p>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-header">
            <h3>Step 1: Your Personalized Protocol</h3>
            <span class="step-timing">Delivered within 24-48 hours</span>
          </div>
          <p>Based on your assessment answers, our practitioners personally review your case and create a customized gut healing protocol designed for YOUR specific symptom pattern, history, and lifestyle.</p>
          <p>This isn't a generic "elimination diet" printout you could find free online. It's a week-by-week roadmap that tells you exactly what to do, when, and why.</p>
          <ul class="step-features">
            <li>Tailored to YOUR primary symptoms — <span class="gut-pattern">Mixed Pattern</span></li>
            <li>Considers what you've already tried — so you don't repeat past failures</li>
            <li>Adjusts based on your responses each week</li>
          </ul>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-header">
            <h3>Step 2: Weekly Check-Ins & Protocol Adjustments</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Every week, you log your symptoms and meals using our simple tracking system. Our practitioners review your progress personally — not an algorithm, a real person who knows your case.</p>
          <p><strong>If something isn't working?</strong> We adjust your protocol.<br>
          <strong>If you hit a plateau?</strong> We troubleshoot together.<br>
          <strong>If you're unsure about a reaction?</strong> You have someone to ask.</p>
          <p>You're never left guessing. You're never stuck alone wondering <em>"is this normal?"</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-header">
            <h3>Step 3: Unlimited Practitioner Messaging</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Questions don't wait for business hours. That's why you have unlimited access to message our practitioner team anytime — day or night.</p>
          <p><em>"Can I eat this at my friend's dinner party tonight?"</em><br>
          <em>"Is this reaction normal or should I be concerned?"</em><br>
          <em>"I'm traveling next week — how do I stay on track?"</em></p>
          <p>Just ask. We respond within 24-48 hours (often much faster). No extra charge. No "saving up" questions for your next appointment.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-header">
            <h3>Step 4: Weekly Live Q&A Sessions</h3>
          </div>
          <p>Every week, our practitioners host a live Q&A session where you can get real-time answers to your questions. Hear what's working for other members. Learn from cases similar to yours.</p>
          <ul class="step-features">
            <li>Weekly live session with Paulina or Rebecca</li>
            <li>Ask questions directly or just listen and learn</li>
            <li>Full recordings available if you can't attend live</li>
          </ul>
          <p>These sessions often surface insights you didn't know you needed — watching others troubleshoot their protocols helps you troubleshoot yours.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="step">
          <div class="step-header">
            <h3>Step 5: Peer Community (Matched by Symptom Type)</h3>
          </div>
          <p>You'll be connected with other members dealing with similar symptoms. Not random people giving random advice — fellow members on structured protocols, sharing what's working and supporting each other.</p>
          <ul class="step-features">
            <li>Matched with peers based on your gut pattern</li>
            <li>Moderated community (dangerous advice gets removed)</li>
            <li>The support of people who truly understand your daily reality</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Because sometimes you just need to talk to someone who <em>gets it</em>.</p>

      <div class="container">
        <h2>Why We Recommend the 6-Month Journey</h2>
        <p>Here's what our practitioners know from years of clinical experience:</p>

        <div class="timeline">
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h4>Weeks 1-2: Initial Adjustments</h4>
            <p>Your body starts responding to the protocol. Some symptoms may temporarily shift as your gut adapts. This is normal — and we guide you through it.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h4>Weeks 3-4: First Signs of Improvement</h4>
            <p>Most members notice reduced bloating, more predictable digestion, or better energy. You start to feel hopeful again.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h4>Months 2-3: Real Progress</h4>
            <p>Patterns stabilize. You start identifying YOUR specific triggers with confidence. The guesswork ends.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="timeline-item">
            <h4>Months 4-6: Lasting Change</h4>
            <p>Your gut microbiome rebalances. You learn to maintain results without constant restriction. Freedom returns.</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="truth-statement">
          <p><strong>The truth:</strong> Quick fixes don't exist for gut health. Anyone promising results in 7 days is lying to you.</p>
          <p>Real healing takes time — but 6 months from now, you can be free from the symptoms that control your life today.</p>
          <p>Or you can be exactly where you are now. Still guessing. Still suffering. Still hoping the next thing will finally work.</p>
          <p><strong>That's why our 6-month option exists.</strong> It's not about locking you in — it's about giving your gut the runway it actually needs to heal.</p>
