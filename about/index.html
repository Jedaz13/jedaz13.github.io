                <h2>Why We Started This</h2>

                <div class="story-content">
                    <p>A few years ago, I was running a video production agency with my partner. The work was exciting but the stress was relentless. Deadlines, client demands, late nights — I pushed through it all.</p>

                    <p>Until my body started pushing back.</p>

                    <p>It started with discomfort after meals. Then unpredictable bathroom emergencies. Then pain that made me afraid to eat. I told myself this was just my new normal — the price of building a business.</p>

                    <p>One evening changed that. I had a flare so severe I thought I might pass out. I was alone, scared, and had to call my girlfriend to rush home. That's when she said something I'll never forget:</p>

                    <blockquote class="story-quote">"This isn't normal. You need help."</blockquote>

                    <p>She was right. But finding that help? That was its own nightmare.</p>

                    <p>Doctors ran tests, prescribed medications, and sent me on my way. "You're fine," they'd say — but I wasn't fine. There was no follow-up. No step-by-step guidance. No one helping me understand <em>why</em> this was happening or <em>how</em> to actually heal.</p>

                    <p>I spent a year searching for answers. Trying elimination diets. Reading research papers at 2 AM. Testing supplements. Some things helped. Many didn't. And I'm still on my own healing journey today.</p>

                    <p>But through all of it, I discovered something important: <strong>I wasn't alone.</strong> Millions of people — especially women over 40 — are dealing with the exact same frustration. Dismissed by doctors. Overwhelmed by conflicting advice. Suffering in silence because gut issues feel embarrassing to talk about.</p>

                    <p>That's why I created Gut Healing Academy.</p>

                    <p><strong>This is the support system I wish I'd had.</strong> A place where you're paired with qualified practitioners who don't just diagnose and disappear — they guide you through every step of your healing journey. Where you're never alone with your symptoms. Where someone actually follows up and adjusts your plan until you feel better.</p>

                    <p>You deserve more than "you're fine" when you're clearly not. You deserve real answers and real support.</p>
